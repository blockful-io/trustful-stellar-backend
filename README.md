### Environment Setup

For development, create `.env`:

```bin/bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:123@postgres:5432/nest"
```

## Running the Application

The application uses Docker for consistent development environments. Follow these steps to get it running:

1. Build and start the containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command will:

- Set up a PostgreSQL database
- Create necessary database tables
- Start the NestJS application
- Watch for file changes during development

2. Wait for the initialization to complete. You should see logs indicating the server is running.

The API will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Database Management

When running the application for the first time or after schema changes:

1. Generate Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

2. Run migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

3. Seed the database (if needed):

```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```

4. To view your database using Prisma Studio:

```bash
